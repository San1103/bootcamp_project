	In my project I started with a paddle and used conditional statements to make it take in user inputs. I made the first paddle red to represent player 1, and the second paddle blue to show that it's a player 2.
	I used classes for Player and Ball, this allowed me to organise my project easier and allowed me to debug things faster.
	I added a trail-effect on the ball to make the game more visually appealing, and as for single player, I added a score counter.
	In single player, the ball eventually gets faster and faster each time there's a successful collision with the player. This way it makes the game more challening as well as fun.
